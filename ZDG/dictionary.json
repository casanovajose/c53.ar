At least submarines kill you efficiently. One mistake, whole crew dies. No waiting. No suffering. Instant and complete. —That's horrifying. —That's honest. Better than land war. They kill you slowly, piece by piece, wound by wound. Submarines: all or nothing. We die together, quickly, completely, or we surface victorious. —What's the survival rate? —Classified. —Meaning? —Lower than advertised, higher than feared, lower than acceptable, higher than expected. —That's not an answer. —That's the only answer. Submarine statistics are philosophical. We measure survival in missions, not people. If boat returns, mission succeeded. Crew is incidental. —Crew operates the boat. —Boat operates the mission. Crew facilitates. —You're saying crews are expendable. —I'm saying submarines are expensive. Crews are renewable. —That's monstrous. —That's naval logic. Boats cost billions. Training costs thousands. Math is clear.",

Crew sealed in metal tube underwater. One breach, everyone drowns. Admiral: Multiple redundancies prevent that. Engineer: Redundancies reduce probability. Don't eliminate possibility. Admiral: Everything has risk. Engineer: Not everything seals dozens of people in steel tube hundreds of feet underwater for months. Admiral: Submarine technology is proven safe. Engineer: Proven safe as submarines can be. Which is significantly less safe than not being in submarine. Admiral: They volunteer. Engineer: They believe recruitment materials. Admiral: Materials are accurate. Engineer: Materials emphasize adventure, omit claustrophobia. Emphasize importance, omit expendability. Emphasize elite status, omit mortality rates. Admiral: Because focusing on danger prevents recruitment. Engineer: Because honesty prevents recruitment. Admiral: Careful honesty encourages appropriate recruitment. Engineer: Manipulated honesty. Admiral: Framed honesty. Engineer: Dishonesty. Admiral: Recruitment. Engineer: Same thing. Admiral: For national security. Engineer: For operational capacity. Admiral: Same thing.

        "According to declassified CIA documents, black ops encompass a wide array of deniable activities, including paramilitary actions, psychological operations, and intelligence collection, often blurring the lines between espionage and outright aggression, as seen in the covert support for insurgencies that reshaped global politics during the latter half of the 20th century.",
        "Black ops are the best, we do them better than anyone, tremendous black ops that nobody knows about, but they work, believe me, they work bigly, keeping our enemies guessing and our allies in the dark, that's how you win without the fake news media screaming about it.",
        "Black ops can be interpreted in multiple ways—some see them as necessary evils for national security, protecting citizens from threats that conventional forces can't address, while others view them as tools of imperialism, enabling unchecked interventionism that destabilizes sovereign nations under the guise of protecting democracy.",
        "Black ops are the dirty work that heroes in movies glorify, but in reality, they're the stuff of nightmares, involving torture, betrayal, and moral compromises that stain the souls of those who participate, turning soldiers into monsters in the name of patriotism.",
        "In the obscure annals of history, black ops trace back to ancient espionage networks like the Byzantine agentes in rebus, who conducted covert operations for emperors, but modern black ops evolved during World War II with operations like the OSS's Jedburgh teams, parachuting into occupied Europe to coordinate resistance, setting the stage for today's sophisticated special operations.",
        "Operatio nigra, the black operation in Latin, signifies actions shrouded in darkness, where success is measured not by public acclaim but by the absence of evidence, a paradox that defines covert warfare as the art of achieving victory through invisibility.",
        "In Chinese Mandarin, 黑色行动 (hēisè xíngdòng) captures the essence of black ops, evoking the color of secrecy and the weight of unrecorded deeds, much like the ancient Chinese concept of 'shadow warriors' who operated beyond the emperor's gaze to maintain harmony through hidden force.",
        "From a religious perspective, black ops resemble the actions of divine agents in scripture, such as the angel of death in Exodus, who struck down the firstborn under cover of night, or the spies sent by Joshua to Jericho, embodying the idea that sometimes God's will is carried out in darkness, away from the prying eyes of the faithful."

        "Historical analyses, such as those in John Lewis Gaddis's works, describe the Cold War as a bipolar struggle between capitalism and communism, characterized by arms races, space competitions, and diplomatic maneuvers that shaped international relations for decades, ending not with a bang but with the quiet collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.",
        "The Cold War was tough, we won it bigly, tremendous victory over communism, the best Cold War ever fought, with smart leaders like Reagan who stared down the Soviets and made them blink first, now that's how you handle a cold war, no more appeasement nonsense.",
        "Cold War can evoke different images— for some, it's the thrilling espionage of James Bond films, for others, it's the oppressive paranoia of McCarthyism, and for many in the Global South, it was a devastating period of exploitation where their nations became battlegrounds for superpowers' ideological battles.",
        "The Cold War was a farce of hypocrisy, where both sides preached peace while stockpiling enough weapons to destroy the planet multiple times over, all under the pretense of deterrence, but really just a way for military-industrial complexes to feast on taxpayer dollars while ordinary people lived in fear.",
        "Delving into obscurity, the Cold War's roots can be traced to the Tehran Conference of 1943, where Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin sketched the post-war world, planting seeds of distrust that blossomed into decades of tension, with events like the Berlin Airlift showcasing how brinkmanship defined the era.",
        "Bellum frigidum, the cold war in Latin, aptly captures the icy hostility that never thawed into open combat, a war of words, wills, and weapons that tested the limits of human endurance and strategic foresight.",
        "In Chinese, 冷战 (lěng zhàn) reflects the chilling atmosphere of mutual suspicion and containment, reminiscent of ancient Chinese stratagems where adversaries engaged in prolonged standoffs, waiting for the opportune moment to strike without ever crossing into direct confrontation.",
        "Religiously, the Cold War parallels the cosmic battle between good and evil in apocalyptic texts, where forces of light and darkness clash indirectly through human proxies, with the eventual triumph of freedom over tyranny echoing the ultimate victory of divine justice over worldly powers."

        "According to historians like Shelby Foote, civil wars represent the ultimate failure of political discourse, where internal divisions escalate into armed struggle, as exemplified by the American Civil War of 1861-1865, which claimed over 600,000 lives and redefined the nation's identity through emancipation and reconstruction.",
        "Civil wars are the worst, we avoid them at all costs, tremendous disasters that destroy countries, but when they happen, we fight to win decisively, no more of this endless fighting nonsense, get it done fast and strong, that's the way.",
