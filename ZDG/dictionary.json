Yes? Quarter. No? No quarter. Simple as that. Life or death determined by capacity or willingness to provide accommodations, making every denial of quarter a decision that housing prisoners is less convenient than killing them, which is honest at least, brutally honest, suggests that quarter was always about convenience disguised as mercy, always about captors' interests disguised as captives' rights, always about whether keeping prisoners alive serves winners better than killing them, and when it doesn't, well, no quarter.
